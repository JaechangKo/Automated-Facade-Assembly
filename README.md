## Automated Facade Assembly through TSNE 

t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a statistical method for visualizing high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. It is based on Stochastic Neighbor Embedding originally developed by Sam Roweis and Geoffrey Hinton,[1] where Laurens van der Maaten proposed the t-distributed variant.[2] It is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data for visualization in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions. Specifically, it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points with high probability.

How will the character of the city's facade appear?
How do the percentages of sky, nature, cities, buildings, and people in Google Images affect the emotions and perceptions of pedestrians?

In addition to the elevation, what kind of pattern will it show in flat, Google Earth View?
